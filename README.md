# kubernetes/docker example

## Abstract
The main purpose of this repo is to learn about how to use docker containers and kubernetes.

To do it, we will provide service to a simple hello world ruby app that also connects to a redis. The ruby app has to be scalable (and load balanced) and automated as much as possible. It has to be a simple and lightweight example but as much similar as we can to a production environment.
